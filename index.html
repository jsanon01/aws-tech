    <header>Introduction to AWS</header>
    <article>  
      <p>21st century is well-known for the digital age; needless to say that everything is based on information technology.</p>

<p>AWS has made History by running massive-scale technologies not only around the world  with a technical presence in several geographical regions, availability zones, and edge-locations but also using "Products & Services" such as computing, networking, storage, and database.</p>

<li>I cannot talk about AWS without mentioning the following advantages of Cloud Computing:
<ol>
<li><b>Gaining agility</b> meaning to provision resources almost instantly;</li> 
<li><b>Avoiding guessing capacity</b> meaning to scale up or down when needed;</li> 
<li><b>Avoiding physical infrastructure</b> like physical data centers, racking, wiring just to name a few;</li>
 <li><b>Going global in minutes</b> compared to traditional model that takes 3-6 months;</li>
 <li><b>Moving from capital expenses to flexible expenses</b> means to facilitate innovation as many times as you want instead of spending money on purchasing hardware</li></ol>
</li>
<li>AWS follows the "shared-security model" meaning AWS is responsible for the <b>security of the cloud</b> while customers are responsible for the <b>security in the cloud.</b></li>
<li>There are four primary certifications that can be obtained; Developer, SysOps Administrator, DevOps Engineer and Solutions Architect. There are also two different levels of Solutions Architect certification. The first level is Associate, and the highest level is Professional.</li>

    <p><i>"10 years ago, Amazon Web Services was launched with little fanfare as a side business for Amazon.com. Today, it’s a highly successful company in its own right, riding a remarkable $10 billion run rate,"</i> according to <a href="www.techcrunch.com">TechChrunch.com.</a></p>

  <p><i>In fact, AWS has grown into the most successful cloud infrastructure company on the planet, garnering more than 30 percent of the market. More than its three closest rivals — Microsoft, IBM and Google — combined,</i> according to data from Synergy Research.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Speaking recently at an event in Washington, DC, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, who has been there from the beginning, explained <i>how these core systems developed out of need over a three-year period beginning in 2000, and, before they knew it, without any real planning, they had the makings of a business that would become AWS.</i></p>

    <header>Amazon VPC Components</header>
    <article>
      <p>By creating your <b>Virtual Private Cloud standing for VPC</b> which means your own "logically isolated region, you have complete control over the networking."</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>VPCs</b> are <u>region specific</u> meaning for multiple regions, you need to create different VPCs.</li>
        <li><b>Subnets</b> are <u>Availability Zone specific</u> meaning for multiple AZs, you need to create multiple subnets.</li>
        <li>New subnets should be created between CIDR block range of: /19 = 8,190 IP addresses and /28 = 16 IP addresses</li>
        <li><b>Route Table</b> (or internal mapping traffic) is automatically set up when creating a VPC. Thus, each subnet should have its own route table.</li>
        <li><b>Internet Gateway (IG)</b> allows your VPC to communicate with the Internet</li>
        <li><b>NAT Instances</b> are not only located in Public Subnet but also act like a bridge to connect the Private Subnet to the Internet in order to download firmware updates and database patches.</li>
        <li><b>NAT Gateway</b> is a managed service which provides better availability and bandwidth and performs the same functions as NAT instances.</li>
        <li><b>Egress-Only Internet Gateway</b> allows VPC to communicate with the Internet for <u>IPv6 traffic only</u>.</li>
        <li><b>Elastic Network Interface (ENI)</b> is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance. ENI's attributes are: MACaddresses, 1 IPv4, 1 or more IPv6, 1 or more security group, a source/destination/check flag and description.</li>
        <li><b>Elastic IP address (EIP)</b> is not only a static IP address but also a public IPv4 address. <br>Public IP addresses are dynamic whereas Elastic IPs get allocated to your account, and stay the same.</li>
        <li><b>Security Group (SG)</b> not only acts as a virtual firewall but also is <u>instance specific</u> meaning different SGs for different instances.
        <br>SGs are <u>stateful</u> means changes applied to incoming rule (allowed Port 80) automatically apply to outgoing rule (opened Port 80).</li>
        <li><b>Network Access Control List (NACL)</b> acts as a firewall and is <u>subnet specific</u>.
          <br>NACLs are <u>stateless</u> means changes applied to incoming rule <b>will not be applied</b> to the outgoing rule. e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, you would also need to apply the rule for outgoing traffic.</li>
        <li><b>VPC Peering</b> allows 1 VPC to connect to another using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. <b><i>You can't peer VPCs across regions.</i></b></li>
        <li><b>VPC Endpoint</b> allows you to connect to VPC and other services outside like S3 and Dynamo DB. <i>No public IPv4 and Internet Gateway needed.</i></li>
        <li><b>VPC Flow Logs</b> enables you to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.</li>
        <li><b>Default VPC</b> is created in each region by default. with the following features: Dynamic Public & Private IPs, Public & Private DNS names...</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Compute">
    <header>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</header>
    <article>
  Networking play an important role in how applications are going to talk to each other. EC2 has the following features: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Scalability:</b> you can scale up and scale down at any point.</li>
  <li><b>Time to market:</b> EC2 can be deployed almost instantly.</li>
  <li><b>Cost effective:</b> you don't really have to pay for a huge capital expense.</li>
  <li><b>Reliable:</b> EC2 is 99.95 percent available for each region.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <center><img src="ec2_types.jpg" alt="vpc image" align="right" height="222" width="422"></center>
There are 5 types of EC2 instances available:
<ol>
  <li><b>General-purpose:</b> suitable for light workloads. Example web servers.</li>
  <li><b>Compute optimized:</b> suitable for high performance computing. Example gaming servers, media transcoding, batch jobs...</li>
  <li><b>Memory optimized:</b> suitable for running in-memory databases.</li>
  <li><b>Storage optimized:</b> suitable for data warehouse applications. </li>
  <li><b>Advanced computing:</b> good for machine learning algorithms, molecular modeling...</li>
</ol>
  AWS provides multiple pricing options depending on your payment flexibility and instance's duration:
<ul>
  <li><b>On-demand instance:</b> you pay just for the usage with no upfront and hidden costs.</li>
  <li><b>Reserved instance:</b> requires either 1 or 3-year commitment with a discount up to 75%.</li>
  <li><b>Spot instance:</b> is great for workloads that can restart from where they failed. Discount is up to 90%.</li>
</ul>

    <header>Databases on AWS</header>
    <article> 
      A database management system (DBMS) is the software that controls the storage, organisation, and retrieval of data. DBMS and RDBMS are often used interchangeably.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order for data to be accessible, RDBMS follows certain rules to ensure data integrity:
    <ul>
      <li>The first integrity states that <b>rows should be distinct.</b></li>
      <li>The second integrity states that <b>column values must not have repeating groups or arrays.</b></li>
      <li>The third integrity is about <b>the concept of NULL which means a column's value is not known.</b></li>
    </ul>
      <p><b>Various ways to host your Database</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Scenario 1:</u> Hosting the DB in your Data Center (On-Premises) | <i>you have to take care of everything.</i></li>
        <li><u>Scenario 2:</u> Hosting the DB on Amazon EC2 Servers | <i>it is a shared-responsibility.</i>
          <ul>
            <li>You take care of App optimization, Scaling, HA, DB backups, DB Software patches, OS patches.</li>
            <li>AWS take care of OS installation, maintenance, racking, power, cooling, networking, and so on...</li>
          </ul>
          
         </li>
        <li><u>Scenario 3:</u> Hosting the DB using Amazon RDS |<i> AWS does all the heavy lifting for you.</i></u></li>
