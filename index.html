      <p>Python is not only easy to learn and as powerful as friendly but also runs everywhere.</p>

<p>Can Python be used on client-side server? Yes, Python can be used as web programming. In addition, Python is a high-level language with good package support and several mature Web application frameworks such as Django, Flask and Tornado.</p>

<li>Python (like PHP, Ruby, and Node.js among others) is a server-side technology so naturally your code is going to be executed server-side, in the case of a Web application.</li>
<li>Which software is used for Python? Eclipse supports many other languages as well. Koding a free online development environment for many programming languages including Python. NetBeans, is written in Java and runs everywhere where a JVM is installed. PyScripter, Free and open-source software Python IDE for Windows..</li>

    <p>Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that not only emphasizes code readability but also provides constructs enabling clear programming on both small and large scales.</p>

  <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Moreover, Python does not use curly braces; however, the use of indentation is mandatory in this formatted language</p>

    <p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages. You can use it for automation, appliction interfaces as well as building web applications like Instagram and Dropbox.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header>Hello world</header>

To get started with writing Python, open the IDE and write your first "Hello world" Python code:
<code>print("Hello " + yourName) </code>

Just press Enter after the code...!

  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Such examples are: x = 5 and y = 'John'
    </p>
    <p>
If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:   x = 4 and y = 'Sally' print(x + y)
    </p>
    <p>
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set. For examples: x = 4 and later x = 'Sally' print(x)
    </p>

    <header>Declaring variables</header>
    <article>
 A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables: 
      <p>
      A variable name cannot start with a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
    <header>Numbers</header>
    <article>
     <p> There are three numeric types in Python:</p>

<p>Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. Ex: x = 5 or y = 3377777</p>
<p>Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. Ex: x = 1.32 y = 1.0 z = -98.01</p>
<p>Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part. Ex: x = 3+5j
y = 5j  z = -5j</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
    <header>Strings</header>
    <article>
<p>String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello"</p>

<p>Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</p>

<p>When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.</p>

<p>List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</p>

<p>You access the list items by referring to the index number:</p>
    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(thislist[1])

    <header>Data types Arrays</header>
    <article>
      <p>Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead. </p>
      <!-- <li><p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
</ul>
      <li>and Object</li> -->
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
    car1 = "Ford"
    car2 = "Volvo"
    car3 = "BMW"

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
<ul>
  <li>Equals: a == b</li>
  <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
  <li>Less than or equal to: a < b</li>
  <li>Greater than: a > b</li>

</ul>
<p>
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
Python has two primitive loop commands:

<code>while (condition)
  statement</code>
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

<p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

      <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>

Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

<code>var n = 0;
var x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}</code>
<p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>

<li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
<li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
<li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
 <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="For_Loop">
    <header>For Loop</header>
    <article> 
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

      <li>Loop through a string.</li>
      <li>The break statement</li>
      <li>The continue statement</li>
      <li>The range function</li>
      <p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming language, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>

<code>for (condition)
  statement</code>
<p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the keyword for, we will have a loop through the letters in 'banana'. For example, <code>for x in "banana":
                                      print(x)</code> .
      </p>
<p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</p>
